AAPL,Bullish,"$AAPL The Biden government, after hearing it,said he pays your taxes.

They do not want perennial inflation, as it loses government,American Citizens and capitalism.

why??

Simple. ..Tax erodes. and the government doesn&#39;t suit it.Less power of revenue and public expenditure and also income to citizens,consequently,less taxes to collect.

I think they&#39;re somehow looking for cost-solving and more cost-effective oil-generation costs.

That is why we have negotiated with oil-producing countries.To minimize transport costs and lower gasoline prices, which insists on different sectors.

Conclusion: I Think,slowly inflation, going downing progressively or descending for the next months. 

USA, the principal economy, around the world.  

Between Venezuelan with Europe,USA. Agreed,sending Petroleum companies Repsol,Erin Petroleum And Chevron. for covering Barrel Deficit. Approximately 900M.Per day.

The next big test for the markets arrives at 8:30 a.m. ET as the Bureau of Labor Statistics discloses its latest print on U.S. inflation. Traders already got nervous in the previous session, with the Nasdaq plunging nearly 3% and the Dow posting a decline of more than 600 points. &quot;There&#39;s a bit more chatter, call it whisper numbers, for the Consumer Price Index being a little north of expectations,&quot; said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.

Snapshot: The consensus estimate among economists predicts an 8.3% increase for the main CPI number, which would match last month&#39;s figure, but mark a slight slowdown from the record 8.5% seen in March. Market sentiment could get dented if today&#39;s reading comes in higher than 8.3%, but may also get bolstered if it matches expectations or shows slower gains. Wall Street would take that as a sign of a peak in price pressures, with the Fed needing to be less aggressive in its tightening cycle later this year.",2022-06-10T12:05:19Z,3084945,Melbenross,232,20829,465168367,

Apple&#39;s Inflation Problem

Apple&#39;s stock trades at about 24 times earnings, but the company&#39;s revenues will likely grow by low single digits in the coming years.

Apple&#39;s stock is overpriced here, has limited upside, and may reach about $100 or lower when the recession arrives.

“We currently have two Phase 3 assets in SLE, including dapirolizumab pegol in collaboration with UCB; and BIIB059, our anti-BDCA2 antibody developed in-house at Biogen. These two assets represent potential first-in-class molecules in SLE. BIIB059 also has the potential to be a first-in-class biologic in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or CLE. CLE is a skin-based autoimmune disease that can be associated with severe scarring and dyspigmentation.”

DNKN,Bullish,"$LKNCY CRUDE VALUATION:
buyout chatter over Dunkin has made this data interesting again. Granted Inspire brands THINKS Dunkin is worth 9B, it didn&#39;t reach that value on the public markets. They pay a premium to compensate shareholders, but at the end of the day, they wouldn&#39;t do the deal if they didn&#39;t see this company being worth 9B in the near future (3-5 year horizon at most)

LKNCY 1.1B mc / 4500 locations = $244,444 per loc
$DNKN 9B mc / 21,000 locations = $428,571 per loc

-DNKN will be acquired at a 75% premium per location relative to LKNCY.
-LKNCY would have to trade at $8.33 to equal Dunkin&#39;s takeover valuation. 

Another caveat is that DNKN shares carry more value due to their buyback history and 1.56% dividend yield. Also 8,000 of the Dunkin locations are actually Baskin Robbins, which are much crappier investments, lower sales and lower growth.",2020-10-27T15:44:10Z,222119,FireItUp,148,4082,252747382,

When $SBUX $DNKN $SHAK or $MCD report revenue, it&#39;s real revenue 

For those that missed it, this shady company just released 
 full q2 results hidden in a 400 page filing.

The truth is BFI missed expectations  and did a measly $15 million in revenue in the first half of 2020, less the $8 mil a quarter. Documented in picture. 

This is a tiny company in terms of revenue and they are generating losses

Please read filing dated 9/25 form prem 14a, all financials for q2 are hidden here, screenshot is page 121

I have only blocked those who reported me like 5th grade children or those disrespectful, all these paid pump bulls and employees never saw this filing, do NO DD and had no idea their pathetic company only did $15 mil in first half revenue, these are FACTS!!! See for yourself

But currency is not blockchain’s killer application. Not even close. Maybe not even in the top 100 applications. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed public ledger. It records ownership and transactions for all things without the need for any intermediary. It will disrupt almost every industry.

I would prefer that we never hear the term “crypto currency” to refer to digital assets again. It’s like calling the internet the “email web”.

Euro STOXX 50 futures were up 5 points at 3,758, FTSE futures remain unchanged, and German DAX futures were higher 8 points higher at 14335, by 0430 GMT.

Asian shares fell on widespread investor worries over high inflation and the threat of recession.

Oil prices fell by around $3 a barrel in Asian trade as investors cashed in on a recent rally with a key producers meeting later in the day set to pave the way for expected output increases.

MARKET VIEW
Euro STOXX 50 futures were down 1 points at 3,680, FTSE futures lost 7 points to 7,517, and German DAX futures were higher 6 points higher at 14033, by 0430 GMT.

Asian share markets slipped after minutes from the Federal Reserve&#39;s early May meeting showed a majority backing half-percentage-point rate hikes in June and July, and as persistent concerns over global growth sapped confidence.

Second, $6B in gross revenues. ~$1.5B in Q1 with $90M loss which was caused by cost increases in logistics and decreased consumer spending due to inflation. Both are manageable issues. Logistics efficiency and  lower costs as much as possible.

At $7, JPM is saying this will hit a low that hasn’t been seen since September 2001. Even in March 2020, when shit hit the fan for the entire market, this only went to $10.xx.

JPM is doing nothing but attempting to further manipulate a stock with over 40% of the available float shorted, roughly 26% of all shares are shorted.

Anything short of calling this manipulation would be incorrect. At $7, market cap would be &lt;$200M. For a company with $6B in annual revenues and ZERO debt.

Interesting to note is how these major banks have performed the past 5 months in an environment of increasing interest rates. You see higher interest rates makes banks profits higher due to a higher spreads in the rates when they lend. Yet they have dropped considerably. 

I believe this is because the market attempts to pre-price the future. Investment firms and investors have pre-priced the fact that interest rate hikes will be temporary. This is further supported recently by the fact that the Federal reserve is taking a more neutral approach now as it believes inflation is “subsiding”. 

Couple this with the fact that Biden’s approval rating is near 36% and the market will Pre-price the Nov. midterms this summer too, and I firmly believe we will see a full reversal in the market and in particular the most hard hit sectors. Expect another bull market since a Republican majority in congress will stop the executive branch from raising corporate taxes.

Apple&#39;s stock trades at about 24 times earnings, but the company&#39;s revenues will likely grow by low single digits in the coming years.

Apple&#39;s stock is overpriced here, has limited upside, and may reach about $100 or lower when the recession arrives.

Lastly, MicroStrategy had also secured bitcoin-backed loans. These loans were first-of-its-kind loans when they were taken out by the software company. The $205 million was also used to purchase more BTC with an interest rate of around 4%.

MU,Bullish,"$MU I think that Harsh Kumar&#39;s downgrade due to consumer impact on Micron is a buying opportunity. 
 
A clear message from the CEO of $HPQ in their latest ER call indicated that the consumer PC market is in deed dipping from the pandemic high, but the CEO noted that the Enterprise PC segment is strong and where $HPQ drives higher margin.  The Enterprise PC market also requires much more DRAM to support AI and other critical applications. 
 
As the CEO or Qualcomm has stated, along with others like the CEO of Intel, Chip shortages of high value chips will continue into 2024... and capacity to manufacture chips needs to double!  The shortage of chip making equipment takes a long time to overcome, and the demand for chips is not one time blip... increasing demand for chips is driven by expanding productivity solutions that will continue to grow.  New Autos require 10X chips and will grow to another 10X shortly. 30% of all chips are memory.

It started 4 min after the open approx 150k shares sold, then 9 min later about 400k shares sold then 20 min after the open we started to get smaller but consistent  sales that took us to the low of the session. 35 min after the open people realized what was happening and we started to see some serious  buying with 1.4 mil shares bought and that took the stock to $3.75 
Relative Volume now is at a whopping 23.49 on no news.
This is definitely an institution with a big position and possibly CFO Zeng selling more.  Also the effect of having more shares available to Short by the 2.86 mil shares award to CFO Zeng. We should see some filing soon to explain this. The way these shares were being sold was unprofessional and it shows a high level of panic or emergency.

NFLX,Bearish,"Bear Market Rally.  A bear market rally refers to a sharp, short-term rebound in share prices amid a longer-term bear market decline. Bear market rallies are treacherous for investors who mistakenly come to believe they mark the end of an extended downturn. As the primary bearish trend reasserts itself, the disappointment of those who bought during a bear market rally helps to drive prices to new lows. Bear market rallies are also known as a dead cat bounce or a sucker rally.

Apple&#39;s Inflation Problem

Apple&#39;s stock trades at about 24 times earnings, but the company&#39;s revenues will likely grow by low single digits in the coming years.

Apple&#39;s stock is overpriced here, has limited upside, and may reach about $100 or lower when the recession arrives.

These stocks exhibit the volatility of the OTC without the higher fees and draw on margin multiplier.  Investors need to tread carefully during these difficult macro-economic times; however, if you take a long position on these Companies and look beyond 12-24mos, I think that each one of these investments can clear 50-100% gains from the current consolidation levels.  In the interim, it is possible to swing trade 15-30% on the volatility alone.  Again-I think that if/where inflation stabilizes/abates from the rising interest rates, the Fed will likely pause on future rate increases to let the economy breathe, and the broader market will show a substantive (positive) uptrend, if only temporarily.  I see this possibly happening in 2H-2022 with a peak (hopefully) inflation of 8% shown in May.",2022-06-04T02:11:12Z,5296575,BinaryLogic,1520,1547,463955310,

I leave y’all with this final post ! 

Tesla has done 5:1 split 2020 stock was split to 5 and now they’re giving 2 shares for every share you hold for a total of 3:1 dividends (split) 

Jesus v1.0 did pretty much the same thing when he split 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish:

&quot;The Feeding of the 5,000 is also known as the &quot;miracle of the five loaves and two fish&quot;; the Gospel of John reports that Jesus used five loaves and two fish to feed a multitude.&quot;

In SUMMARY There’s :

Stock Split (split existing shares) 
Stock Split Dividends (given additional shares to match split ratio) 

Value is the same just the way to meet the split ratio ! 

What you need to know from the point cascade of squeezes initiate   to the retrace post split: 👇

👉Tesla Stock Split yields 44% upside after all set n done !! 
👉 Stocks that generally split tend to perform better with higher return to shareholders than the ones they don’t! 
👉Reflect management confidence and upcoming catalysts !! 
👉More buyers than sellers with potential calls squeeze (huge)
